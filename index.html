    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate Gray & Amber -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a top navigation bar to switch between three main views: 'University Profiles', 'Overview & Comparison', and 'Key Trends'. This dashboard-like structure allows users to first dive into detailed information for each university, then get a high-level comparative understanding via charts, and finally synthesize the evolution of the field. The flow is designed to guide the user from specific details to broad comparison and then to overarching insights, which is a more intuitive way to consume a dense benchmarking report than a linear document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: University XR Commitment/Investment Rating. Goal: Compare institutions directly. Viz: Interactive Bar Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Hovering over bars shows the exact rating. Justification: A bar chart is the clearest way to compare a single quantitative metric across multiple entities. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Evolution of XR from 2020 to 2025. Goal: Illustrate the shift in focus and maturity. Viz: HTML/CSS based visual timeline. Interaction: Clicking on trend titles reveals descriptive text. Justification: A timeline is a natural and effective way to represent change over time, making the report's trend analysis more dynamic and engaging than a simple text list. Method: HTML/CSS with JS for interactivity.
        - Report Info: Detailed university profiles. Goal: Provide in-depth, organized information. Viz: Interactive HTML cards. Interaction: Clicking a university logo/name expands to show a detailed card with categorized information. Justification: This keeps the main view uncluttered while providing easy access to comprehensive data, preventing information overload. Method: HTML/CSS with JS for toggling visibility.
